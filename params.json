{"name":"Tortellini - A badge clock and sociability indicator","tagline":"Don't wear your heart on your sleeves.","body":"Tortellini\r\n==========\r\n\r\nTortellini is a programmed Arduino based badge that has two functions: a clock and a sociability indicator. The badge is the BoilerBadge (https://github.com/boilermake/boilermakebadge_i) and has an ATMega32U4 microprocessor and an nRF24L01 radio. It is based off of the Arduino Leonardo and has sixteen green LEDs evenly arranged in a circle.\r\n\r\nClock\r\n======\r\n\r\nIn the clock mode, four LEDs show the binary representation of the hour from 0 to 12. One LED blinks according to the second. The other eleven LEDs show show minutes in five minute increments.\r\n\r\nSociability Indicator\r\n============================\r\n\r\nIn the sociability indicator mode, each badge (slave) will receive a command from the central badge (master). The command from the master will light the slave's LEDs according to the slave owner's computed sociability level, on a scale from 0 - 100 %. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
