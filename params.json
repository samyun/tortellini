{"name":"Tortellini - A badge clock and personality metrics indicator","tagline":"Don't wear your heart on your sleeve - wear it on your chest.","body":"Tortellini\r\n==========\r\n\r\nTortellini is firmware for the Arduino Leonardo-based [BoilerBadge](https://github.com/boilermake/boilermakebadge_i) that provides \"social motivation\". By boasting behavioral data from fitness trackers (for example, the completion of a daily step goal) or a personality metric (IBM Watson's impression of one's niceness, determined by their social media), users will be more inclined to accomplish their goals and improve themselves.\r\n\r\nClock\r\n-------\r\nIf no metric is selected, a binary/analog clock is displayed. Four LEDs in the upper-left quadrant show the binary representation of the hour from 0 to 12. The top LED blinks each second. The other eleven LEDs indicate the minutes of the hour (in five minute increments).\r\n\r\nPersonality Metrics\r\n-------\r\nIn the personality metrics mode, each badge (slave) will receive a command from the central badge (master). The command from the master will light the slave's LEDs according to the slave owner's computed personality level, on a scale from 0 - 100 %.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
